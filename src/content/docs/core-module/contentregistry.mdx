#### A registry to see which mod owns which piece of content.
The `ContentRegistry` is a static class that acts as a central database for all custom content loaded by PEAKLib. Its primary role is to keep track of which mod owns which piece of content.

| Member | Description |
|----------|----------|
| `Register<T>(T, ModDefinition)` (static method) | The base method for registering content. Typically called from a content-specific Register method. |
| `IsRegistered(this IContent)` (extension method) | Checks if a piece of content has already been registered. |
| `TryGetRegisteredContent<T>(...)` (extension method) | Attempts to get the `RegisteredContent<T>` wrapper for a piece of content. |


<Aside type="caution">
For the most part, you will not need to interact with the `ContentRegistry` directly. PEAKLib's other systems (like `BundleLoader` and `ModDefinition`) handle the registration process for you. This documentation is for advanced use cases, such as creating compatibility with other mods.

## Core Purpose

The registry allows you to look up a piece of content (like an item or status effect) and find out which `ModDefinition` it belongs to. This is incredibly useful for creating "synergy" effects between different mods.

## Using the Registry

The registry's methods are exposed as extension methods for any object that implements the `IContent` interface.

### `IsRegistered()`

Checks if a piece of content has been successfully registered.

```csharp
// Assuming 'myCustomItem' is an IContent object
if (myCustomItem.IsRegistered())
{
    Logger.LogInfo($"{myCustomItem.Name} has been registered!");
}
```

### `TryGetRegisteredContent<T>(...)`
This is the most useful method for compatibility. It attempts to get the `RegisteredContent<T>` wrapper for a piece of content, which contains both the content itself and its owning ModDefinition.


### Example: Creating Item Synergy
Imagine your mod adds a "Fire Ring" item. You want it to have a special bonus effect if the player is also holding the "Ice Amulet" from another mod.

```csharp
using PEAKLib.Core;
using PEAKLib.Items; // Assuming the other mod uses PEAKLib.Items

public class FireRingSynergyChecker
{
    public void CheckForSynergy()
    {
        // You first need a way to get a reference to the other mod's item content.
        // This might involve looking it up by name from the game's ItemDatabase.
        Item iceAmuletItem = ItemDatabase.Instance.GetItem("Ice Amulet");

        if (iceAmuletItem == null) return; // The item doesn't exist.

        // Create an ItemContent wrapper to interact with the registry
        var iceAmuletContent = new ItemContent(iceAmuletItem);

        // Now, use the registry to see who owns it
        if (iceAmuletContent.TryGetRegisteredContent(out var registeredAmulet))
        {
            // We found it in the registry!
            string ownerModId = registeredAmulet.Mod.Id;
            Logger.LogInfo($"Ice Amulet is owned by: {ownerModId}");

            // Check if it's owned by the specific mod we want to synergize with
            if (ownerModId == "com.coolmodder.icemod")
            {
                Logger.LogInfo("Synergy activated! Granting fire resistance bonus.");
                GrantFireResistance();
            }
        }
    }

    private void GrantFireResistance() { /* ... */ }
}
```
