#### Manages the registration and spawning of networked GameObjects.
The `NetworkPrefabManager` is a static class that manages the registration and instantiation of networked `GameObjects`.
It replaces the game's default networking pool with a custom one that is aware of mod-added prefabs, preventing errors and ensuring your objects can be spawned by the host.\

If you want to spawn a custom item, projectile, or any other object that needs to be visible to all players in a multiplayer session, you must use this manager.

| Member | Description |
|----------|----------|
| `RegisterNetworkPrefab(ModDefinition, GameObject)` | Registers a prefab with a mod association. |
| `RegisterNetworkPrefab(ModDefinition, string, GameObject)` | Registers a prefab with a mod association and a specified resource folder path (e.g., "0_Items/"). |
| `TryRegisterNetworkPrefab(string, GameObject)` | Attempts to register a network prefab; returns false if the ID is already taken. |
| `HasNetworkPrefab(string)` | Checks if a prefab with the given ID is registered. |
| `TryGetNetworkPrefab(string, out GameObject)` | Attempts to retrieve a registered network prefab by its ID. |
| `SpawnNetworkPrefab(...)` | Spawns a registered network prefab across the network. Must be called by the Master Client. |

## Registering a Network Prefab

Before you can spawn an object, you must register its prefab with the manager. This is typically done right after you load your AssetBundle.

### `RegisterNetworkPrefab(...)`

This is the primary method for registration. It takes your `ModDefinition` and the `GameObject` prefab as arguments.

<Aside>
PEAKLib automatically prefixes the prefab's name with your mod's unique ID to prevent conflicts with other mods. 
`com.yourname.yourmod:MyAwesomeItem`
</Aside>

```csharp
// In your BundleLoader callback
this.LoadBundleAndContentsWithName("my-items.peakbundle", bundle =>
{
    // Load the prefab from the bundle
    var myProjectilePrefab = bundle.LoadAsset<GameObject>("FlameProjectile");

    // Register it with the NetworkPrefabManager
    // The folder path is important for some game systems. Use "0_Items/" for items.
    // For other objects, you can often leave it empty or use a custom path.
    NetworkPrefabManager.RegisterNetworkPrefab(Definition, "MyProjectiles/", myProjectilePrefab);

    Logger.LogInfo("FlameProjectile is now registered for network spawning!");
});
```

## Spawning a Network Prefab
Once registered, a prefab can be spawned by the Master Client (the host).

### `SpawnNetworkPrefab(...)`
This method instantiates the registered prefab across the network.

Only the host (Master Client) can spawn new room objects. Any attempt to call this from a client will result in an error. Always check PhotonNetwork.IsMasterClient before calling this method.

```csharp
using Photon.Pun;
using UnityEngine;

public class MagicWand : ModItemComponent
{
    public void CastFireball()
    {
        // Ensure this code only runs on the player who owns the item
        if (!photonView.IsMine)
        {
            return;
        }

        // The actual spawning must be requested from the host.
        // A common pattern is to send an RPC to the host, who then calls SpawnNetworkPrefab.
        // For simplicity, this example assumes the current player IS the host.
        if (PhotonNetwork.IsMasterClient)
        {
            // The prefabId must match the name given during registration (ModID:PrefabName)
            string prefabId = $"{Mod.Id}:FlameProjectile";
            Vector3 spawnPosition = transform.position + transform.forward * 2f;
            Quaternion spawnRotation = transform.rotation;

            NetworkPrefabManager.SpawnNetworkPrefab(prefabId, spawnPosition, spawnRotation);
        }
    }
}
```

## Helper Methods
### `HasNetworkPrefab(string prefabId)`
Checks if a prefab with the given ID (e.g., "com.yourname.mod:MyPrefab") is already registered.

### `TryGetNetworkPrefab(string prefabId, out GameObject prefab)`
Attempts to get the registered prefab GameObject by its ID.
